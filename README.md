Super Mini PHP Proxy
=================

A super mini php proxy made within 5 minutes for multiple uses.

I've made this just becouse i work with a vm machine in my pc as testing area but i got an ip like 192.168.231.128 that will be not visible from outside my pc.
For test a web site in my smartphone I have used this for bypass this problem calling an url as http://192.168.1.4/proxy/192.168.231.128/.

How to use:

Just call the address you want to visit after your superminiphpproxy path.

Eg.
http://127.0.0.1/proxy/www.google.com
http://www.yourwebsite.com/proxy/www.google.com

Enjoy it!
